A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C++.
Two players take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3×3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe
Run the program.

The board will display a 3×3 grid.

Players take turns entering their move as row and column numbers (1–3).

Example: typing 1 1 places a mark in the top-left.

The game announces when a player wins or if it’s a draw.
